# CPP Car Rental System
This is a Car Rental Program that I made in C++, complete with usernames and passwords to protect your sessions! Built version included.

To run the program type this into your terminal:

```
./carrental
```
Or alternatively you can build the C++ project with `g++`, `clang++`, or with any other C++ project builder.
