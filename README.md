# CPP Car Rental System
This is a Car Rental Program that I made in C++, complete with usernames and passwords to protect your sessions! Built version included.

## How To Run

First navigate to the directory (the folder in this repo) that contains the project:


Then, to run the program, type this into your terminal:

```
./carrental
```
Or alternatively you can build the C++ project with `g++`, `clang++`, or with any other C++ project builder.

Enjoy!
